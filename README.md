# JK-project-lake-house
This project builds a data lakehouse solution on AWS for the STEDI Step Trainer system. The goal is to curate sensor and mobile application data so that it can be safely used by Data Scientists to train a machine learning model for step detection, while respecting customer privacy and consent requirements.
